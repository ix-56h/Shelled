# IMPORTANT
X			Error handler
			all functions on parser have the stack in argument, need to make a if on all parse functions begin

X			Check assignment_word 
				- Need to check for the 7b rule if the current word is the first or not
X			Rewrite tokenizer and process tokens as described in , don't forget all process during tokenization and after (alias, expansion etc):

# Important notes
The WORD tokens shall have the word expansion rules applied to them immediately before the associated command is executed, not at the time the command is parsed.

X	need to refactor code (wordexp_tokenizer.c need to be refactored, all usage of *i *anchor need to be reviewed)

# OTHERS
O			Redirections like ">> toto ls"
O			Quotes
?			Subshell
X			need see 7b rule in misc.c
X			here documents


X			check for this command
